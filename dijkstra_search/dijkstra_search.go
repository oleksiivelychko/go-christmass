DijkstraSearch

Only for weighted graphs.
Weighted graph - a graph in which each edge is assigned some weight(value) e.g. number.
For negative weights must be used Bellmanâ€“Ford algorithm.

1. Each vertex has minimal-known distance (costs) to V(start).
2. V(start) assigned as 0, V(finish) assigned as infinity.
3. All vertices marked as non-processed.
4. Iterate graph and try to reduce cost to make it to V(finish).
5. Get one of non-processed vertex which has minimal cost.
7. Vertices from this V(E) named `neighbors`.
8. For each neighbor considers new distance (nodeCost+neighborCost)
9. If its value less than replace with new distance.
